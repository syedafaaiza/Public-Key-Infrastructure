The primary objective of this project is to implement a robust PKI to enhance the
security of Domain Name System (DNS) operations. The DNS is often referred
to as the "phonebook of the internet," translating human-friendly domain names
into IP addresses. Given its crucial role in internet navigation, the DNS is a prime
target for various attacks, including DNS spoofing and cache poisoning. These
vulnerabilities can compromise the integrity and confidentiality of user data,
making it imperative to secure DNS operations.
This project focuses on establishing a secure environment through the
implementation of PKI, which includes acquiring a domain, setting up an SSL
certificate, and configuring a web server to facilitate encrypted communications.
By leveraging PKI, we aim to protect data during transmission, ensure the
authenticity of communications, and instill confidence in users regarding the
security of the DNS services provided.
Overall, the implementation of PKI not only safeguards sensitive information but
also contributes to a more secure and trustworthy internet experience for all users.
